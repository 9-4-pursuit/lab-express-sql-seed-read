# Instructions Issues

https://github.com/9-4-pursuit/lab-express-sql-seed-read/blob/main/README-FE.md

Instructions state "npm start".  In terminal, this results in

/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node/18.9.0/bin/node: bad option: --openssl-legacy-provider

https://github.com/9-4-pursuit/lab-express-sql-seed-read/blob/main/README-FE.md#songs

Instructs to take to "songs/:id, but see below.  Also apparently

"IMPORTANT

Your page should" (cut off, so we don't know what the important bit was).

In another section,

"IMPORTANT - be sure it goes to the song's id NOT the array position." - referenced later.

https://github.com/9-4-pursuit/lab-express-sql-seed-read/blob/main/README-FE.md#songsindex

instructs to take to "songs/:index" (contrary to earlier instruction "songs/:id".  From description, this is, essentially, songs/:id.  As the instruction for the previous section instructs us to use the song's id, not the array position (i.e. index), I am using song id.)

https://github.com/9-4-pursuit/lab-express-sql-seed-read/blob/main/README-FE.md#edit-functionality

instructs to take to "songs/:id/edit"


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
